# üß† Langraph Agent ‚Äì Agent2Agent Protocol Implementation

This agent is part of the Langraph Agents implementation under the Agent2Agent Protocol using JSON-RPC 2.0. The Langraph Agent leverages the powerful Langraph framework for advanced agent orchestration, workflow management, and complex multi-agent interactions.

## üéØ What Does the Langraph Agent Do?

The Langraph Agent is a sophisticated autonomous agent system designed to:
- Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows using Langraph's graph-based architecture
- Manage state and context across agent interactions
- Execute parallel and sequential agent tasks
- Handle complex reasoning chains and decision trees
- Provide robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This agent is built on the Langraph framework, enabling powerful graph-based agent orchestration and workflow management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Dependencies from root `pyproject.toml`
- OpenAI API Key (set in `.env` as `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### üõ†Ô∏è Running the Agent Server

1. Navigate to the agent directory:
   ```bash
   cd a2a_poc/langraph
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uv run .
   ```

üì° The server will run on `http://localhost:10000`

### üß™ Testing the Agent

Run the test client in a new terminal to simulate a JSON-RPC request:
```bash
uv run test_client.py
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Code Location
The agent is defined in:
```bash
langraph/langgraph_agent.py
```

### Key Methods

#### `.invoke(query: str, session_id: str = None) -> dict`
Processes a request through the Langraph workflow and returns structured results.

Returns a response object containing:
- `status`: Current execution status
- `result`: The processed result
- `workflow_state`: Current state of the workflow
- `metadata`: Additional execution metadata

#### `.stream(query: str, session_id: str = None) -> AsyncIterator[dict]`
Streams workflow execution updates in real-time.
- Emits state transitions
- Workflow progress updates
- Intermediate results
- Error states and recovery attempts

## üì§ API Usage

### JSON-RPC 2.0 Interface

The agent can be accessed via the JSON-RPC 2.0 interface.

#### Sample Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test_001",
    "method": "workflow/execute",
    "params": {
      "id": "workflow_001",
      "sessionId": "session_001",
      "workflow": {
        "type": "sequential",
        "steps": [
          {
            "agent": "reasoning",
            "input": "Analyze the following problem: ..."
          },
          {
            "agent": "execution",
            "input": "Based on the analysis, execute the following steps: ..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

### üì• Supported Content Types
The Langraph Agent supports the following MIME types:
- `application/json`
- `text/plain`

## üß† Implementation Notes

## üìä Workflow Types

The agent supports several workflow patterns:

1. **Sequential Workflows**
   - Linear execution of agent steps
   - State preservation between steps
   - Conditional branching

2. **Parallel Workflows**
   - Concurrent agent execution
   - Result aggregation
   - Resource optimization

3. **Graph-based Workflows**
   - Complex agent interaction patterns
   - Dynamic routing
   - State management across nodes
