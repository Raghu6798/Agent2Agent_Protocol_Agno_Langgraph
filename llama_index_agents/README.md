# üé® LlamaIndex Brand Image Agent

A sophisticated AI-powered brand image generation agent built with LlamaIndex that creates professional marketing visuals using natural language descriptions. This agent is part of the Agent2Agent Protocol implementation using JSON-RPC 2.0.

## üéØ What Does the Brand Image Agent Do?

The agent is a specialized marketing assistant that:
- Generates professional product images using AI
- Creates optimized marketing prompts
- Handles complete brand image generation workflows
- Uses Together AI's FLUX.1.1[Schnell] model for image generation
- Leverages Llama 3.3 8B for natural language understanding

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Together AI API Key (set in `.env` as `TOGETHER_API_KEY`)
- OpenRouter API Key (set in `.env` as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)

### üõ†Ô∏è Running the Agent Server

1. First, clone the repository and Navigate to the llama_index agent directory::
```
git clone https://github.com/Raghu6798/Agent2Agent_Protocol_Implementation.git

cd Agent2Agent_Protocol_Implementation/lama_index_agents:
```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uv run .
   ```

üì° The server will run on `http://localhost:10000`

### üß™ Testing the Agent

Run the test client in a new terminal to simulate a JSON-RPC request:
```bash
uv run test_client.py
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Code Location
The agent is defined in:
```bash
llama_index_agents/llama_index_agent.py
```

### Key Methods

#### `.invoke(query: str, session_id: str = None) -> str`
Processes a brand image generation request and returns the result.

Example:
```python
result = agent.invoke(
    "Generate a brand image for a luxury watch called 'Chronos Elite' with a minimalist design and gold accents",
    "session_123"
)
```

#### `.stream(query: str, session_id: str = None) -> AsyncIterator[dict]`
Streams the image generation process in real-time, showing:
- Initial analysis
- Marketing prompt creation
- Image generation progress
- Final result with image URL
